Description: Interactive computing environment (metapackage)
 Project Jupyter provides tools for interactive computing, useful for data
 science, scientific computing and learning. Computational languages for
 multiple languages are available; the name Jupyter is derived from
 Julia, Python and R.
 .
 This package depends on a standard set of Jupyter packages;
  - the core and client libraries
  - the console interface
  - the web-based notebook
  - tools for working with and converting notebook (ipynb) files
  - the python3 computational kernel
 .
 The various jupyter components can be called using the /usr/bin/jupyter
 entrypoint, eg "jupyter notebook".
